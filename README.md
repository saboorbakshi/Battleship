# Battleship

Implemented a widely popular game, [battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) in Kotlin.

This game is designed to played with a mouse.

How to play:
* Place all 5 ships onto your formation.
  * Left clicking a ship selects it.
  * Dragging the mouse whilst having the ship selected drags the ship.
  * Right clicking on a ship rotates it to the right by 90 degrees. 
  * Releasing the left-hand button releases the ship.
  * Releasing a ship anywhere but inside your formation animates the ship back to its original position
  * Overlapping two ships is restricted.
* Once all ships are placed, the Start Game button is activated.
